Sure, here is an example of how you can use a selectbox with a pandas dataframe for the list of options, where the options are randomly selected from a list of chemical elements. The user can select one of the options and get a message in return if the selected symbol matches the correct symbol for the given element. The evaluation and message display will only happen after the user makes a selection. The process will repeat until the user selects the wrong answer. This example uses Streamlit's Session State to preserve state across reruns.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a pandas DataFrame with chemical elements and their symbols
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Element': ['Hydrogen', 'Helium', 'Lithium', 'Beryllium', 'Boron'],
    'Symbol': ['H', 'He', 'Li', 'Be', 'B']
})

# Initialize session state
if 'correct' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.correct = True
if 'element' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.element = np.random.choice(df['Element'])

# If the previous answer was correct, randomly select a new element
if st.session_state.correct:
    st.session_state.element = np.random.choice(df['Element'])

# Ask the user to select the symbol for the randomly selected element
selected_symbol = st.selectbox(
    f'What is the symbol for {st.session_state.element}?',
    [''] + list(df['Symbol'])) # Here we are using the 'Symbol' column of the dataframe as the options for the selectbox

# If a symbol is selected, check if it is correct and display a message
if selected_symbol:
    # Get the correct symbol for the selected element
    correct_symbol = df[df['Element'] == st.session_state.element]['Symbol'].values[0]

    # Check if the selected symbol is correct
    if selected_symbol == correct_symbol:
        st.write('Correct! The symbol for', st.session_state.element, 'is', correct_symbol)
        st.session_state.correct = True
        st.experimental_rerun() # Rerun the script to ask for another element
    else:
        st.write('Incorrect. The symbol for', st.session_state.element, 'is', correct_symbol)
        st.session_state.correct = False
```

#In this example, an element is randomly selected from the dataframe, and the user is asked to select the correct symbol for this element from the selectbox. The options in the selectbox are the symbols from the dataframe. After the user makes a selection, a message is displayed indicating whether the selected symbol is correct. If the answer is correct, the script reruns to ask for another element. The process repeats until the user selects the wrong answer.

#Please note that this example assumes that you have a dataframe with the names of the chemical elements and their corresponding symbols. If your dataframe is different, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

#Also, please note that this example uses Streamlit's Session State to preserve state across reruns. You can read more about Session State in the [Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.session_state).
